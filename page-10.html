        <p style="text-align:justify;">In an election campaign winning is everything; there is no consolation for being a runner-up. With the increasing penetration of television and internet, voters today are more informed, independent and discerning in casting their vote. The traditional methods of political campaign planning whilst being useful need a major upgrade to develop an effective election campaign strategy. Some of the most important <b>THREE</b> questions that need answered <b>“Who are the most important voters we need to win?” “Where and how do we reach them?” “What do we need to do and say to persuade them to cast their vote for us?”</b> Understanding your voter and connecting with them is the X-factor. We help you fathom the voters’ need – what would persuade them – and the most effective way to reach out to them.</p>

          <li> <b>VOTER SEGMENTATION:</b> knowing your voters is the key to winning elections. However, effective voter segmentation goes beyond caste and coalition combinations. Here lies the science of discovering your advocates and adversaries and most importantly, the winnable, also known as the Swing voters. Our unique and proprietary understanding and targeting of the ‘Swing’ voters is the difference between winning and losing the election. </li><br>
          <li><b>CAMPAIGN MESSAGING:</b> Most elections around the world are fought on similar issues. It is the effective articulation of these issues that connects you with the voters. Simplicity and clarity of your messages help you break through the clutter. We develop and test messages of their ‘persuasiveness’ so you know for sure the impact of your messages in winning the minds and hearts of your voters. </li><br>
          <li><b>CANDIDATE POSITIONING:</b> You might mean something to somebody and nothing to everybody. Projecting your image as a candidate of choice to winnable/swing voters helps you get ahead of others. What is the image that would mobilise the voters? Using our battleground positioning framework, we help you develop your public persona that will mobilise the voters to vote for you.</li>
          <br>
          <li><b>VOTER SENTIMENT TRACKING:</b> So how do you know if what you are doing is working? If you wait for the Election Day, it might be too late. The campaign office will feed you anecdotes and ground intelligence. But 360i Digital will be your independent voice that would tell you whether the voters are with you or moving away. Our election campaign management services include deploying a monitoring system that gives you a moving picture which is actionable, you can make the necessary and timely course corrections to win and stay in office</li>
